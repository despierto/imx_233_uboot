XBoot for Freescale i.MX233: Applications Processor

http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=i.MX233

The i.MX233 applications processor based on the ARM926EJ-S™ can run at speeds up to 454MHz and is targeted for cost sensitive consumer applications. The power management unit (PMU) integrates a DC-DC switching converter and multiple linear regulators to provide power sequencing for the device itself and drive I/O peripherals such as memories and SD cards as well as providing battery charging capabiity for Li-Ion batteries. The i.MX233 also integrates mixed signal analog audio with a 1.5W Mono speaker amplifier, a stereo headphone DAC with 99dB Signal-to-Noise ratio and stereo ADC with 85dB Signal-to-Noise ratio with integrated amplifiers.
